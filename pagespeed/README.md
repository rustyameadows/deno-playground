Tried to use

Ran into issue:

```
error: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'https://deno.land/std/flags/mod.ts' does not provide an export named 'Args'
export { parse, Args } from "https://deno.land/std/flags/mod.ts";
```

Not sure I need this library right now. Going to try and use the google API
directly via fetch
